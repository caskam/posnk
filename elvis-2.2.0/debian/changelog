elvis (2.0-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Here is the latest version of the much-discussed elvis package...  I
    think I have now gotten everything fixed and cleaned up for 
    Debian 1.2  Please check things out though...
  * Changed elvis from "Recommends: elvisctags" to "Suggests: elvisctags"
    This fixes bug #5416 and should make dselect users happy.
  * Changed the behavior of "vi -G x11" to drop to the default gui 
    (i.e. termcap) when the x11 gui is unavailable.  This allows users
    of elm to specify "vi -G x11" as their primary editor, and have
    elvis use the X interface when in X, and the text interface when in
    console mode.  This will make the one person who asked happy.
  * Fixed bug #5393 by splitting up the config directory and moving the
    non-config files to several locations.
  * Added a script to ensure that old versions of elvis get completely
    removed from the system regardless of a little dpkg problem, by
    installing 0 byte files on top of the old files, and then deleting
    the 0 byte files in the postinst script. Credit goes to Guy Maor
    for the idea (which works).
  * Rewrote the printdoc.bat file, and moved it to /usr/bin/elvis-printdoc
  * elvisctags now utilizes update-alternatives for ctags, ref, and their
    associated man pages.  I recommend that the all other packages
    which also provide these programs do likewise.
  * Please note that in order to comply with the Debian standard, I
    installed all man pages compressed in /usr/man/man1; however, since
    elvis cannot read compressed files, I have installed a second,
    uncompressed copy of the man pages in /usr/doc/elvis/online-docs. 
    I have also installed the online help files uncompressed in this
    directory to allow elvis to access them.

    simply need to type "vi -G x11"
  * Added some some nice defaults and color syntax highlighting to elvis.ini.
  * I probably did some other stuff too, but I don't remember what. :-)
