Description: powerful clone of the vi/ex text editor (with X11 support)
 This package contains Elvis compiled with support for X11, Xft and
 background images.  If you don't need the X11 interface, install
 elvis-console instead.  See also: elvis-tools
 .
 Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor. It supports
 nearly all of the vi/ex commands, in both visual mode and ex mode.
 Elvis adds support for multiple files, multiple windows, a variety of
 display modes (including syntax highlighting, man, tex, html and
 hex), an optional X11 user interface, on-line help, folding, spell
 checking, new options, auto commands, regions, enhanced tags,
 printing, aliases and an improved :map command.
 .
 Like vi/ex, Elvis stores most of the text in a temporary file,
 instead of RAM. This allows it to edit files that are too large to
 fit in a single process' data space.
 Also, the edit buffer can survive a power failure or crash.

Description: text editing tools for programmers (elvfmt, elvtags, ref)
 This package contains elvtags (for generating tags and refs
 files), ref (for quickly locating/displaying the header of a
 function) and elvfmt (for adjusting paragraphs of text).
 .
 These tools actually belong to the Elvis editor but can be used
 without it.
