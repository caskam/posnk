elvis (2.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The elvis package has been split into elvis-common, elvis,
  elvis-console and elvis-tools.

    elvis-common:
      This package provides the common files (manual, ex scripts,
      digraph files, etc.) that are needed by the packages elvis,
      elvis-console and elvis-tools.

    elvis:
      This package contains Elvis compiled with support for X11, Xft
      and background images.  If you don't need the X11 interface,
      install elvis-console instead.

    elvis-console:
      This package contains Elvis compiled without X11 support.  If
      you want to use Elvis' X11 interface then install the package
      elvis instead.

    elvis-tools:
      This package contains elvtags (for generating tags and refs
      files), ref (for quickly locating/displaying the header of a
      function) and elvfmt (for adjusting paragraphs of text).
      These tools actually belong to the Elvis editor but can be used
      without it.

  As a consequence of this, elvfmt, elvref and elvtags will be removed
  if you're upgrading from an earlier version of the elvis package.
  In this case, just install elvis-tools afterwards if you need them.
  Also note that elvref is now again installed as ref.
